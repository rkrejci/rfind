Radek's find (rfind) User Manual
================================

Requirements
------------
- cmake
- gcc (or other compatible compiler)
- find(1) (for tests)


Building
--------

$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
# make install


Tests
-----

The project includes several test cases to compare rfind(1) and find(1) outputs.

$ make test

To see the details, run

$ ctest -V


Usage
-----

$ rfind [-H] [-L] [-P] [path...] [expression]

Symbolic links handling options. Multiple options can be set, but only the last
is used.

  -P    Never follow symbolic links. This is the default behavior.
  -L    Follow symbolic links.
  -H    Follow symbolic link only of the provided paths.

Default path is the current directory.
Default expression is -print, expression may consist of OPERATORS, FILTERS and
ACTIONS.

OPERATORS (decreasing precedence):
    ( EXPR )
    ! EXPR  -not EXPR
    EXPR1 -a EXPR2  EXPR1 -and EXPR2
    EXPR1 -o EXPR2  EXPR1 -or EXPR2

TESTS:
    -empty
            The file is empty.
    -iname PATTERN
            Same as -name, but the match is case insensitive.
    -name PATTERN
           Filter files by their name matching the shell PATTERN. Only the name
           is matched, not the directory. The metacharacters include `*', `?',
           and `[]'.  Don't forget to enclose the pattern in quotes in order to
           protect it from expansion by the shell.

ACTIONS:
    -print0
            Print the full file name on the standard output followed by a null
            character.
    -print
            Print the full file name on the standard output, followed by a
            newline. This is the default action when no action is specified.


Differences to find(1)
----------------------

- The list of rfind(1)'s filters and actions is very limited for now.
- rfind(1) does not support positional and normal find(1)'s options except
  --help and --version.
- The expressions format does not accept the ',' (comma) operator.
- All the operators in expression must be explicit, the -and operator is not
  added implicitly.
